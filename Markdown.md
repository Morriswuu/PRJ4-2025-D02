**Equipment Health & Maintenance Data Analysis**

**Objective**

This project analyzes historical maintenance records to identify maintenance frequency, common failure types, and key factors affecting equipment lifespan. The goal is to optimize maintenance strategies, improve efficiency, reduce costs, and extend equipment lifespan.

**Background & Business Impact**

Inefficient maintenance leads to excessive downtime, high costs, and reduced asset longevity. Key challenges include:

- **High Maintenance Costs**: Frequent breakdowns increase expenses.
- **Unexpected Failures**: Disrupt production and cause financial losses.
- **Inefficient Scheduling**: Over- or under-maintenance impacts performance.
- **Underutilized Data**: Missed opportunities for predictive insights.

Optimizing maintenance can reduce costs, minimize downtime, extend lifespan, and improve decision-making.

**Analysis Approach & Data Requirements**

**1. Data Querying & Cleaning (SQL)**

- Extract and clean maintenance records (equipment ID, date, failure type, cost, downtime).

**2. Data Analysis & Visualization (Python: Pandas, Matplotlib)**

- **Maintenance Frequency**: Identify high-maintenance equipment.
- **Failure Patterns**: Categorize common issues.
- **Cost & Downtime Analysis**: Assess financial and operational impacts.
- **Lifespan Factors**: Analyze correlations between failures, environment, and workload.

**3. Required Datasets**

1. **Maintenance Records**: Dates, failures, repair methods, costs, downtime.
2. **Usage Data**: Hours, workload, operator details.
3. **Equipment Specs**: Model, manufacturer, purchase date, lifespan.
4. **Operating Conditions**: Temperature, humidity, vibration, dust levels.
5. **Maintenance Personnel Data**: Technician efficiency, repair times.

- **Week 9**: Assess repair costs and downtime impact.
- **Week 10**: Develop predictive maintenance insights.

**Late Phase: Optimization & Report (Week 11 - Week 14)**

- **Week 11**: Formulate maintenance optimization strategies.
- **Week 12**: Finalize insights and recommendations.
- **Week 13**: Complete report and presentation prep.
- **Week 14**: Final validation and refinements.

**Expected Outcomes**

1. **Identify high-maintenance equipment and propose preventive strategies.**
2. **Determine key lifespan-reducing factors and optimize usage.**
3. **Suggest cost-reduction strategies via scheduling and durable components.**
4. **Enhance efficiency and minimize downtime through data-driven insights.**
