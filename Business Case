**Equipment Health & Maintenance Data Analysis**

**Objective**


Canon pruction printers, have occuring failings and downtimes related to their Ink Filter Health. 
This Filter is a central component of the System, so it is attached in every Print Run, which makes it harmful for the Printers as well as subsceptible. TO have the Printers fulfill there workflows and production runs,
to not cause any delays or costs of service and not provided prodcuts, the Ink Filters have to be maintained. They arent the only component causing errors, so this project is also about figuring out the role in downtimes of the Ink Filter,
Predicting Downtimes and Maintenance Services. Therefor we can use Prcocess related Data, for analysing and predictions. 
This project analyzes historical maintenance records to identify maintenance frequency, common failure types, and key factors affecting equipment lifespan. 
The goal is to optimize maintenance strategies, improve efficiency, reduce costs, and extend equipment lifespan without direct support investigation.

**Background & Business Impact**

Inefficient maintenance leads to excessive downtime, high costs, and reduced asset longevity. Key challenges include:

- **High Maintenance Costs**: Frequent breakdowns increase expenses.
- **Damaged products**: Damgaged Filter Inks, cause support and investigation activitys.
- **Unexpected Failures**: Disrupt production and cause financial losses.
- **Inefficient Scheduling**: Over- or under-maintenance impacts performance.
- **Underutilized Data**: Missed opportunities for analytical and predictive insights.

Optimizing maintenance can reduce costs, minimize downtime, extend lifespan, and improve decision-making.


**Expected Outcomes**

1. **Identify high-maintenance equipment and propose preventive strategies.**
2. **Determine key lifespan-reducing factors and optimize usage.**
3. **Suggest cost-reduction strategies via scheduling and durable components.**
4. **Enhance efficiency and minimize downtime through data-driven insights.**
