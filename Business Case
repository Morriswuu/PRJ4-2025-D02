**Equipment Health & Maintenance Data Analysis**

### Objective
---
Canon production printers experience recurring failures and downtime related to ink filter health.
This filter is a central component of the system and is engaged during every print run, making it critical to printer performance and prone to wear.
To ensure printers fulfill their workflows and production runs without delays, service costs, or undelivered products, ink filter maintenance is essential.
While ink filters are not the sole component causing errors, this project focuses on determining their role in downtime incidents, predicting maintenance needs, and optimizing service schedules.

The project analyses historical maintenance records to identify maintenance frequency, common failure types, and key factors affecting equipment lifespan.
The goal is to optimize maintenance strategies, improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, and extend equipment longevity without requiring direct support investigations.

### Background & Business Impact
---
Inefficient maintenance practices result in excessive downtime, elevated costs, and reduced asset longevity. Key challenges include:   

- **High Maintenance Costs:** Frequent breakdowns escalate repair and labour expenses.  
- **Product Damage:** Faulty ink filters compromise product quality, requiring support interventions and investigations.  
- **Unexpected Failures:** Unplanned outages disrupt production schedules and incur financial losses.  
- **Inefficient Scheduling:** Excessive or insufficient maintenance compromises system performance.  
- **Underutilized Data:** Unused operational data limits opportunities for predictive and analytical insights.

Optimizing maintenance strategies can reduce operational costs, minimize downtime, extend asset lifespan, and enhance decision-making through data-driven protocols.   

### Expected Outcomes
---
- Identify high-maintenance equipment and establish proactive maintenance strategies.  
- Determine key factors reducing equipment lifespan and optimize operational parameters.  
- Recommend cost-saving measures through optimized scheduling and durable component integration.  
- Enhance operational efficiency and minimize downtime using predictive, data-driven insights.
